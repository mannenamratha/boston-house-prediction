# House Price Prediction

## Overview

This project implements a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features. The goal is to estimate the price of a house given its attributes such as location, size, number of rooms, etc. The project demonstrates the application of predictive modeling techniques to real estate data.

## Features

- **Data Processing:** Clean and preprocess the dataset for analysis.
- **Model Training:** Train a predictive model using features such as size, location, and other relevant attributes.
- **Prediction:** Predict house prices based on the trained model.
- **Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`

## Usage 

Input Data: Prepare a CSV file with the necessary features (e.g., size, location, number of rooms) formatted as specified in the data directory.

Model Training: The script trains a model using the provided dataset.

Prediction: Provide new house data to get price predictions.
